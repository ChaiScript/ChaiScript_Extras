Name: chaiscript
Description: ChaiScript is a scripting language that easily embeds into your existing C++ applications. It's built to be flexible and dynamic, yet still maintain the type-safety you expect as a C++ user. It can natively use classes, methods, and attributes, even if the class inherits functionality from a parent class.
